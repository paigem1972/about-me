# about-me
Hello, my name is Valentine Montana and my email is paigem1972@hstat.org. I'm currently a student at hstat and I'm in the sep10 program. My birthday is February 27th and my deepest darkest secret is that everything I do is purely muscle memory. The following text are facts about me:
1. I'm totally a human being and not a robot.
2. Im bad at spelling.
3. My favorite color is red.
4. I have two dogs, Bruno and Ollie.
5. I have a chronic anxiety disorder.
6. My best friend is Vio Patt

I'm running out of facts about myself so here's my schedule:

1. Chemistry
2. Algebra 2
3. Gym
4. Software engineering 
5. Spanish
6. Lunch
7. English
8. Global history
